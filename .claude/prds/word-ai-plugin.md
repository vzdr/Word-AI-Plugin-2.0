# PRD: Word AI Plugin

## Problem Statement

Users working with Microsoft Word documents frequently encounter situations where they need to:
- Answer questions embedded in documents
- Fill in incomplete information in tables
- Generate content based on their own knowledge base or context files
- Research and populate sections without leaving Word

Currently, this requires:
- Switching between Word and external AI tools
- Copying and pasting content back and forth
- Manually managing context across multiple tools
- Losing formatting during the process

## Solution Overview

A Microsoft Word plugin that enables users to:
1. **Select text** in their document (questions, incomplete sections, table cells)
2. **Provide context** through uploaded files (PDFs, DOCX, TXT) and/or inline text
3. **Get AI-powered answers** that automatically replace the selected text
4. **Auto-fill tables** with AI-generated content based on provided context

## User Personas

### Primary: Business Analyst
- Creates reports and documentation
- Needs to populate templates with data from various sources
- Has context documents (specs, previous reports, data files)
- Values accuracy and source attribution

### Secondary: Researcher/Student
- Writing papers and assignments
- Has research materials in various formats
- Needs citations and fact-checking
- Wants seamless integration with Word

### Tertiary: Content Creator
- Generates marketing materials, proposals
- Has brand guidelines and reference materials
- Needs consistent voice and formatting
- Works with templates

## Key Features

### 1. Text Selection & Replacement
**Description:** Users can highlight any text in their Word document and have it replaced with AI-generated content.

**User Flow:**
1. User highlights text (e.g., "What were Q3 sales figures?")
2. Clicks "Ask AI" button in sidebar
3. AI processes question with provided context
4. Selected text is replaced with answer

**Technical Requirements:**
- Office.js API for text selection and replacement
- Preserve formatting (bold, italic, font) where possible
- Support undo/redo functionality
- Handle multi-paragraph selections

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can select any text in document
- [ ] Selected text is visually highlighted in plugin

4. Uploaded files displayed as removable chips
5. Context persists for the session

**Supported Formats:**
- PDF (text extraction)
- DOCX (Microsoft Word documents)
- TXT (plain text)
- MD (Markdown)
- CSV (for tabular data)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use `pdf-parse` for PDF text extraction
- Use `mammoth.js` for DOCX parsing
- Chunk large documents (max 512 tokens per chunk)
- Max file size: 10MB per file, 50MB total

- [ ] Context is actually used in AI responses

### 3. Inline Context Input
**Description:** Users can type or paste context directly in the plugin.

**User Flow:**
1. User types/pastes context in textarea
2. Context is immediately available for queries
3. Can be edited or cleared anytime

**Technical Requirements:**

### 4. Table Auto-Fill
**Description:** Detect tables and intelligently fill empty cells based on context.

**User Flow:**
1. User places cursor in table or selects table
2. Clicks "Fill Table" button
3. AI analyzes table structure and headers
4. Empty cells filled with contextual data
5. User reviews and accepts/rejects changes

**Technical Requirements:**
- Detect table structure via Office.js

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detects tables in document
- [ ] Reads column headers correctly
- [ ] Fills only empty cells by default
- [ ] Option to override existing content
- [ ] Shows preview/diff before applying
- [ ] Handles merged cells appropriately

### 5. AI Processing & Integration
**Description:** Backend service that processes requests with context.

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/process`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "question": "What were Q3 sales figures?",
  "contextFiles": ["parsed text from files"],
  "inlineContext": "user-provided context",
  "options": {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "maxTokens": 500
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Q3 sales figures were $2.5M...",
  "sources": ["file1.pdf page 3", "inline context"],
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Support OpenAI (GPT-4) and Anthropic (Claude) models
