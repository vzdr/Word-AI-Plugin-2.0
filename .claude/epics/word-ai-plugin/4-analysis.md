# Parallel Work Analysis: Issue #4

## Overview
Create a file upload interface with drag-and-drop support, file validation (type and size), progress indicators, and uploaded file management. This component will allow users to upload context files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, CSV) with a 10MB per-file and 50MB total limit.

## Parallel Streams

### Stream A: Core FileUpload Component
**Scope**: Create the main FileUpload React component with drag-and-drop functionality and file management UI
**Files**:
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/FileUpload.tsx`
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/FileUpload.module.css`
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 8
**Dependencies**: none

**Details**:
- Create FileUpload component with file input element
- Implement drag-and-drop handlers (onDrop, onDragOver, onDragEnter, onDragLeave)
- Display uploaded file list with remove buttons
- Show file metadata (name, size, type)
- Create visual feedback for drag-and-drop states
- Handle multiple file selection
- Implement remove file functionality

### Stream B: Validation & Storage Utilities
**Scope**: Create utility functions for file validation, size calculations, and state management types
**Files**:
- `word-plugin/src/utils/fileValidation.ts`
- `word-plugin/src/types/file.ts`
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Can Start**: immediately
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: none

**Details**:
- Create file type validation (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, CSV)
- Implement file size validation (10MB per file, 50MB total)
- Create error message generation for validation failures
- Define TypeScript interfaces for file data structures
- Create utility for calculating total upload size
- Implement MIME type checking and file extension validation

### Stream C: Integration & Testing
**Scope**: Integrate FileUpload component into App.tsx, add unit tests, and implement progress indicators
**Files**:
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/App.tsx`
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/App.css`
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/__tests__/FileUpload.test.tsx` (if test framework exists)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Can Start**: after Streams A & B complete
**Estimated Hours**: 4
**Dependencies**: Streams A, B

**Details**:
- Add FileUpload component to App.tsx context section
- Manage uploaded files state in App component
- Integrate validation utilities from Stream B
- Add progress indicator during file processing
- Create unit tests for FileUpload component
- Create unit tests for validation utilities
- Manual testing verification

## Coordination Points

### Shared Files
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/App.tsx` - Stream C only (no conflict)
- Type definitions may be imported across streams but defined in Stream B

### Sequential Requirements
1. Streams A & B can run in parallel (no dependencies)
2. Stream C must wait for both A & B to complete
3. Core component (Stream A) and utilities (Stream B) are independent
4. Integration (Stream C) requires completed component and utilities

### Type Coordination
- Stream B defines file-related TypeScript types
- Stream A imports and uses these types
- Both streams should coordinate on type interface design early
- Suggested coordination: Stream B creates basic type structure first, Stream A uses it

## Conflict Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Streams A and B work on completely separate files
- **Low Risk**: Stream C depends on A & B, runs sequentially
- **Medium Risk**: Type definitions need early coordination between A & B
- **No conflicts**: No streams modify the same files simultaneously

## Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: hybrid

Launch Streams A and B simultaneously (they work on independent files):
- Stream A focuses on UI component and drag-and-drop UX
- Stream B focuses on validation logic and type definitions

Start Stream C when both A and B complete:
- Stream C integrates the component into the app
- Adds tests and verifies all validation rules work correctly
- Implements progress indicators

**Coordination Note**: Stream A should coordinate with Stream B on type interfaces early. Stream B can define basic types first, then Stream A can begin implementation.

## Expected Timeline

With parallel execution:
- Phase 1 (Parallel): Streams A & B = 8 hours (max of the two)
- Phase 2 (Sequential): Stream C = 4 hours
- **Wall time: 12 hours**
- Total work: 16 hours
- Efficiency gain: 25%

Without parallel execution:
- Wall time: 16 hours (8 + 4 + 4 sequential)

## Notes
- File upload doesn't actually send files to a backend yet (that's a future task)
- This task focuses on UI/UX and client-side validation only
- Files will be stored in component state for now
- Progress indicator may be simulated since no actual upload happens
- Consider using FileReader API for file preview in future enhancements
- Ensure proper error messaging for better UX
- Follow existing component patterns (see InlineContext.tsx as reference)
- Use CSS modules for styling consistency
