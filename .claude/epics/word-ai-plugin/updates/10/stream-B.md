# Stream B: UI Integration & State Management

## Scope
Add UI components for text replacement flow, loading states, and error handling

## Files
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/App.tsx` (update)
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/App.css` (update)
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/LoadingIndicator.tsx` (new)
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/ErrorDisplay.tsx` (new)

## Progress

### Completed Components

#### LoadingIndicator Component
- Created `LoadingIndicator.tsx` with functional component pattern
- Supports custom message prop
- Three size variants: small, medium, large
- CSS module with animated spinner
- ARIA accessibility attributes (role="status", aria-live="polite")
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility
- Reusable across the application

#### ErrorDisplay Component
- Created `ErrorDisplay.tsx` with functional component pattern
- Accepts string or Error object
- Three severity levels: error, warning, info
- Dismissible with onDismiss callback
- Optional retry button with onRetry callback
- Prominent error icon based on severity
- CSS module with color-coded styling per severity
- ARIA accessibility attributes (role="alert", aria-live="assertive")
- Smooth slide-in animation
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility

### App.tsx State Management Updates

#### New State Properties
- `isProcessing`: boolean - tracks if AI request is processing
- `processingMessage`: string - custom message for loading indicator
- `error`: string | null - global error message
- `errorSeverity`: ErrorSeverity - severity level for error display
- `aiResponse`: string | null - stores AI response before replacement

#### New Methods
- `handleAskAI()`: Placeholder method that sets loading state and simulates AI request
  - Clears previous errors and responses
  - Sets processing state with message
  - Currently uses setTimeout to simulate async operation
  - Ready for Stream C to implement actual AI integration

- `handleReplaceText()`: Placeholder method for text replacement
  - Validates aiResponse exists
  - Sets processing state
  - Currently simulates replacement operation
  - Will be fully implemented with actual Word API integration

- `clearError()`: Dismisses error messages
  - Simple state setter to clear error

#### UI Integration
- Wired up "Ask AI" button to handleAskAI method
- Added LoadingIndicator display when isProcessing is true
- Added ErrorDisplay with retry button when error exists
- Implemented success state UI showing AI response
- Added "Replace Selected Text" and "Cancel" buttons in success state
- Conditional rendering based on state (loading, error, success, default)

### App.css Updates
- Added `.success-state` container styles with gradient border
- Added `.success-header` with icon and title layout
- Added `.success-icon` with circular background
- Added `.success-content` for AI response preview
- Added `.ai-response` pre-formatted text styles
- Added `.success-actions` button layout
- Added `.secondary-button` styles for Cancel button
- Added `@keyframes fadeIn` animation for success state
- Added prefers-reduced-motion media query for accessibility

## Design Decisions
- Followed existing component patterns (functional components with CSS modules)
- Used TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Maintained consistency with existing design system (colors, spacing, typography)
- Prioritized accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, reduced motion)
- Made components highly reusable with props
- Kept AI integration placeholder for Stream C implementation
- Clean separation of concerns between UI state and business logic

## Testing Notes
- Components are ready for integration testing
- State management flow tested with placeholder setTimeout operations
- UI conditionally renders based on state changes
- Error handling structure in place
- Ready for Stream C to replace placeholders with actual AI integration
