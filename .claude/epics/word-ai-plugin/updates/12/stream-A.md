# Stream A: Error Boundary & Offline Detection

## Scope
Create React ErrorBoundary component to catch unhandled errors globally, create OfflineIndicator component for network status detection, create NetworkStatusContext for app-wide offline/online state management, and enhance existing ErrorDisplay component with additional error recovery options.

## Files
- `word-plugin/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (new)
- `word-plugin/src/components/OfflineIndicator.tsx` (new)
- `word-plugin/src/contexts/NetworkStatusContext.tsx` (new)
- `word-plugin/src/hooks/useNetworkStatus.ts` (new)
- Modify: `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/ErrorDisplay.tsx` (enhance with retry count display)

## Dependencies
- None - can start immediately

## Progress
- [x] Created ErrorBoundary component with fallback UI and error logging
- [x] Created NetworkStatusContext with online/offline event detection and optional periodic connectivity probing
- [x] Created useNetworkStatus hook as re-export for cleaner imports
- [x] Created OfflineIndicator component with dismissible warning banner
- [x] Enhanced ErrorDisplay component with retry count display (retryAttempt/maxRetries props)

## Implementation Details

### ErrorBoundary Component
- Class component implementing componentDidCatch lifecycle method
- Provides fallback UI with error message and action buttons
- Includes "Reload" button to refresh the application
- Includes "Try Again" button to reset error state without reload
- Logs errors to console for debugging
- Shows stack trace in development mode
- Fully accessible with ARIA labels
- Files: `ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `ErrorBoundary.module.css`

### NetworkStatusContext
- React context providing network status throughout the app
- Monitors navigator.onLine API
- Listens to browser online/offline events
- Optional periodic connectivity probing via fetch requests
- Configurable probe interval and URL
- Includes NetworkStatusProvider component and useNetworkStatus hook
- File: `NetworkStatusContext.tsx`

### useNetworkStatus Hook
- Clean re-export of hook from NetworkStatusContext
- Provides consistent import path
- Returns { isOnline: boolean }
- Throws error if used outside NetworkStatusProvider
- File: `useNetworkStatus.ts`

### OfflineIndicator Component
- Displays warning banner when offline
- Dismissible by user
- Reappears after 5 seconds if still offline
- Smooth slide-in/out animations
- Configurable position (top/bottom)
- Custom message support
- Accessible with role="alert"
- Files: `OfflineIndicator.tsx`, `OfflineIndicator.module.css`

### Enhanced ErrorDisplay
- Added optional retryAttempt prop (current attempt, 1-indexed)
- Added optional maxRetries prop (maximum attempts allowed)
- Shows "Retry attempt X of Y" when both props provided
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Styled consistently with existing component
- File: Modified `ErrorDisplay.tsx` and `ErrorDisplay.module.css`

## Testing Notes
- All components follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Accessibility features included (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation)
- Responsive design with reduced motion support
- CSS modules follow existing naming conventions
- Components ready for integration by Stream C

## Issues Encountered
None - implementation completed successfully

## Status
Completed - all files created and enhanced as specified
