# Stream A: Core FileUpload Component

## Scope
Create the main FileUpload React component with drag-and-drop functionality and file management UI

## Files
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/FileUpload.tsx`
- `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/FileUpload.module.css`

## Progress

### Completed Implementation

**Component Structure (FileUpload.tsx)**
- Created TypeScript interfaces:
  - `UploadedFile`: Defines structure for uploaded file data (id, file, name, size, type, uploadedAt)
  - `FileUploadProps`: Component props with configuration options
- Props include: files array, onFilesChange callback, size limits, accepted types, error handler

**Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
- Implemented all required drag-and-drop handlers:
  - `handleDragEnter`: Tracks drag entry with counter to prevent flicker
  - `handleDragLeave`: Decrements counter and updates dragging state
  - `handleDragOver`: Prevents default to allow drop
  - `handleDrop`: Processes dropped files and resets dragging state
- Visual feedback through `isDragging` state toggle
- Drag counter prevents false positives from nested elements

**File Management Features**
- Multiple file selection support (via file input and drag-and-drop)
- File metadata display:
  - File name with text overflow handling
  - File size formatted as Bytes/KB/MB/GB
  - File type (extension) displayed
  - Visual file type icons (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, CSV)
- Remove file functionality with smooth UI updates
- Duplicate file prevention (checks name + size)
- Total size calculation and display

**Validation (Basic Client-Side)**
- File type validation against accepted types array
- Individual file size validation (default 10MB max)
- Total upload size validation (default 50MB max)
- Comprehensive error messages for validation failures
- Error callback integration for parent component handling

**UI/UX Features**
- Responsive upload area with hover states
- Active drag state styling (border change, background color)
- Click-to-upload fallback for drag-and-drop
- File list with clean, organized display
- Size information header (current / max)
- Warning when approaching size limit
- Smooth animations for file list items
- Hidden file input element for clean UI

**Styling (FileUpload.module.css)**
- Follows InlineContext component patterns
- CSS modules for scoped styling
- Comprehensive states:
  - Default, hover, and dragging states for upload area
  - File item hover effects
  - Remove button hover states
  - Warning message styling
- Responsive design with mobile breakpoints
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Consistent color scheme with existing components

**Helper Functions**
- `getTotalSize()`: Calculates total size of uploaded files
- `formatFileSize()`: Converts bytes to human-readable format
- `getFileExtension()`: Extracts file extension from filename
- `getFileIcon()`: Returns emoji icon based on file type
- `processFiles()`: Main file processing logic with validation

## Coordination Notes

**For Stream B (Validation & Storage Utilities)**
- Created placeholder `UploadedFile` interface - can be refined with additional validation metadata
- Basic validation implemented in component - Stream B can provide enhanced validation utilities
- Component expects validation logic to be moved to utility functions
- Types can be moved to `word-plugin/src/types/file.ts` when Stream B creates it
- Error handling structure ready for integration with validation utilities

**For Stream C (Integration & Testing)**
- Component is ready for integration into `App.tsx`
- Props structure designed for easy state management in parent component
- Error callback allows flexible error display (toast, alert, inline, etc.)
- File state is managed externally (parent component responsibility)
- All core functionality complete and testable
- Component follows existing patterns for consistency

## Files Created
1. `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/FileUpload.tsx` (278 lines)
2. `word-plugin/src/taskpane/components/FileUpload.module.css` (224 lines)

## Commit
