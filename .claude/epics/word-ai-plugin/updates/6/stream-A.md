# Stream A: Core Server Setup

## Scope
Initialize Express.js server, configure basic middleware, set up environment configuration, create server entry point, and add start scripts.

## Files
- `backend/` (new directory) - CREATED
- `backend/package.json` (new) - CREATED
- `backend/src/server.ts` (new) - CREATED
- `backend/src/config/env.ts` (new) - CREATED
- `backend/tsconfig.json` (new) - CREATED
- `backend/.env.example` (new) - CREATED

## Progress
- Directory structure created
- package.json configured with Express, CORS, Morgan, and TypeScript dependencies
- tsconfig.json configured with strict TypeScript settings
- env.ts configuration module created with environment variable parsing
- server.ts created with Express setup, middleware, CORS, logging, and error handling
- .env.example created with configuration documentation
- Dependencies installed successfully (154 packages)
- Server tested and confirmed running on port 3001

## Implementation Details

### Package.json
- Added Express.js 4.18.2 as main framework
- Added CORS 2.8.5 for cross-origin requests
- Added Morgan 1.10.0 for HTTP logging
- Added dotenv 16.3.1 for environment configuration
- Added TypeScript 5.3.2 and ts-node-dev 2.0.0 for development
- Scripts: dev (hot reload), build (TypeScript compilation), start (production)

### Environment Configuration
- PORT: Default 3001
- NODE_ENV: Default development
- CORS_ORIGIN: Configurable comma-separated list (default: https://localhost:3000)
- API_PREFIX: Default /api
- Type-safe configuration with validation

### Server Features
- Body parser middleware (JSON and URL-encoded)
- CORS configured for Office.js plugin origin (https://localhost:3000)
- Morgan logging (dev format in development, combined in production)
- Root route with server info
- 404 handler for undefined routes
- Global error handler with environment-specific error details
- Server startup with detailed console logging

### TypeScript Configuration
- Target: ES2020
- Strict mode enabled
- Source maps for debugging
- Declaration files generated
- Unused variables/parameters detection
- No implicit returns enforcement

## Test Results
Server successfully starts in development mode:
- Listens on port 3001
- CORS enabled for https://localhost:3000
- Hot reload working with ts-node-dev
- Clean startup with no errors

## Deliverables
All deliverables completed:
- Running Express server on port 3001
- Environment configuration with .env.example
- Development hot reload with ts-node-dev
- CORS configured for Office.js plugin
- Production-ready build setup
